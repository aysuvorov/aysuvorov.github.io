# Statistical modelling and inference testing

Mostly I use R for statistical modelling, analysing clinical trials and doing meta-analysis. 
At the same time, some basic functions for statistics are written in Python. The body of some (not all of them!) functions is quite old. The code will be optimized.

# Machine learning algorithms

A lot of code is already published in the web. At the same time specific tasks require specific tools. Most of the code is in Python since a lot of handy modules are available. 

# Network analysis

Since I am a part of Alexei Zaikin's scientific group, I am familiar with different approaches in network data analysis.
